# MobTimer

In 2016 a crack mob programming unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didn't commit. These men promptly escaped  from a maximum security stockade to the Github underground. Today, still wanted by the government, they survive as open source contributors. If you have a coding problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire the M-Team.
